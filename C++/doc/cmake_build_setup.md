# 🤖 CMake Build Guide for Micro Robot Framework
This document outlines the standard configuration and build process using CMake for projects with a nested structure, specifically for the microRobotFramework components (microRobotFramework_01, microRobotFramework_02, etc.).

## 1. 📁 Required Project Structure
The project uses a standard multi-level structure where a top-level CMakeLists.txt manages the overall project and delegates the actual build definitions to the subdirectories.

The structure for the microRobotFramework_01 component should be:

/C++
├── CMakeLists.txt  <-- Top-level project
├── microRobotFramework_01
│   ├── microRobotFramework_01.hpp    (Header)
│   ├── microRobotFramework_01.cpp    (Source/Library Implementation)
│   ├── mrf_example_01.cpp          (Executable/Main Application)
│   └── CMakeLists.txt              <-- Sub-project build definition
└── microRobotFramework2
    └── ... (similar files and CMakeLists.txt)

## 2. ⚙️ CMake Configuration Files
### 2.1. Top-Level CMakeLists.txt (in /C++)
This file initializes the project and tells CMake to look inside the subdirectories for specific build targets.
```
CMake
# /C++/CMakeLists.txt
# Specify the minimum required CMake version
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
# Define the project name and the language used
project(RobotFrameworks CXX)
# Add all subdirectories that contain their own CMakeLists.txt files
add_subdirectory(microRobotFramework1)
add_subdirectory(microRobotFramework2)
# Optional: Set common build properties for the entire project
# set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug)
```

### 2.2. Sub-Project CMakeLists.txt (in /C++/microRobotFramework1)
This file defines two separate targets: the Library (mrf_lib_01) and the Executable (mrf_example_01), and handles their linkage.

CMake
```
# /C++/microRobotFramework1/CMakeLists.txt

# Define the reusable class implementation as a static/shared library.
# This target contains the core functionality (microRobotFramework_01.cpp).
add_library(mrf_lib_01 
    microRobotFramework_01.cpp
    microRobotFramework_01.hpp
)

# Define the main application/example as an executable.
# This target contains the 'main' function (mrf_example_01.cpp).
add_executable(mrf_example_01 
    mrf_example_01.cpp
)

# Ensure C++11 standard is used for compilation.
target_compile_features(mrf_lib_01 PUBLIC cxx_std_11)
target_compile_features(mrf_example_01 PRIVATE cxx_std_11)

# Link the executable to the library.
# The executable depends on the compiled code in mrf_lib_01.
target_link_libraries(mrf_example_01 PRIVATE mrf_lib_01)

# Specify include path so the executable can find "microRobotFramework.hpp"
# (Assuming the header is in the same directory as the source files.)
target_include_directories(mrf_example_01 PRIVATE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}) 
```

## 3. 🛠️ Build Process
Follow these steps from the root /C++ directory to configure and build your project. This process uses an out-of-source build, which is the recommended practice.

Step 1: Create Build Directory
Bash

cd /C++
mkdir build
cd build
Step 2: Configure CMake
Run CMake to generate the build files (e.g., Makefiles or Visual Studio projects).

Bash

# The '..' points to the parent directory where the root CMakeLists.txt is located
cmake .. 
Step 3: Build the Targets
Use the multi-platform build command to compile the project.

Bash

# This command automatically runs the compiler (e.g., make, ninja)
cmake --build . 
The resulting executable, mrf_example_01, will be located in the build/microRobotFramework1 directory (or similar, depending on the generator and OS).

Would you like to continue by setting up the same CMakeLists.txt for your second subfolder, microRobotFramework2, or do you have additional libraries (like Boost or a specific serial library) that need to be found and linked?
